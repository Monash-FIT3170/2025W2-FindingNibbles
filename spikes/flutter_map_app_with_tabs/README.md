This spike contains a basic map view using the `flutter_map` package and `latlong2`, accompanied by a tab-based navigation bar at the bottom of the app.

To run this spike, you must first setup a Flutter project on your local machine, then overwrite the `lib` file with the contents of the `lib` file in this subdirectory.

You will also need to install the `flutter_map` and `latlong2` packages with the following command:
`flutter pub add flutter_map latlong2`
