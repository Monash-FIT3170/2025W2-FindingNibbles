# Infrastructure

This is where we will store any code/guides related to deploying infrastructure.

Guide that Lachlan followed for frontend deployment located [here](https://medium.com/@colonal/automating-flutter-builds-and-releases-with-github-actions-77ccf4a1ccdd)

The base-64 encoded keystore is included in the Github Repository Secrets, and a backup is stored on Lachlan's laptop.
