# Alternative Approaches to Google Scraping

Since Google is showing CAPTCHAs, here are better alternatives:

## 🏆 **Strategy A: Google Places API (Recommended)**

### Pros:

- ✅ Official Google API - no blocking
- ✅ Reliable, structured data
- ✅ Includes rating, reviews, cuisine, price level
- ✅ 1000 requests/month free, then ~$17/1000 requests

### Setup:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project → Enable Places API
3. Get API key
4. Use Places API to search for restaurants by name + address

### Cost Estimate:

- 63,121 restaurants × $0.017 = ~$1,073
- You could batch/filter to reduce costs

## 🔄 **Strategy B: Rotate IPs/Proxies**

### Pros:

- ✅ Can bypass some blocking
- ✅ Uses existing scraping code

### Cons:

- ❌ Complex setup
- ❌ Still might get blocked
- ❌ Proxy costs
- ❌ Violates Google's terms

## 🎯 **Strategy C: Manual Sampling**

### Approach:

- Manually verify selectors on ~10 restaurants
- Use scraping for smaller batches
- Focus on most important restaurants (closest to CBD)

## 🔍 **Strategy D: Alternative Data Sources**

### Options:

- Zomato API
- Yelp API
- Foursquare/Swarm API
- TripAdvisor scraping
- Local government restaurant databases

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**For your project, I'd suggest:**

1. **Immediate**: Use Google Places API for accurate data

   - Budget: ~$1000 for full dataset
   - Time: 1-2 days implementation
   - Quality: Official Google data

2. **Budget Alternative**: Manual sampling approach

   - Test scraping on 100-500 closest restaurants
   - Use longer delays (10-30 seconds between requests)
   - Run overnight in small batches

3. **Free Alternative**: Combine multiple free APIs
   - Use each API's free tier
   - Cross-reference data quality
